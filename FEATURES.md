- WebSocket reduces HTTP overhead
- Priority queue ensures important tasks first

### 4. Monitoring
**Question**: "How do you monitor system health?"

**Answer**:
- Real-time dashboard with WebSocket updates
- Task statistics (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Health check endpoints
- Prometheus/Grafana integration potential
- Error tracking and alerting

## Extension Ideas

## Metrics That Matter

This project demonstrates:

- **Code Quality**: Type hints, Pydantic models, proper error handling
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns, modular design
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, inline comments, API docs
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready, easy setup, production considerations
- **UI/UX**: Modern, responsive, real-time, user-friendly

## Perfect For

- Backend Engineer roles (Python, FastAPI, Redis)
- Full-Stack positions (Frontend + Backend + DevOps)
- System Design interviews (scalability, reliability)
- DevOps positions (Docker, containerization)
- Microservices architecture roles

## How It Works

This project provides a task queue framework with real-time monitoring. 

For demonstration purposes, tasks simulate work using sleep delays to show progress. In production use, you would replace the `execute_task()` method with actual business logic:

- Sending emails via SendGrid/SES
- Processing CSV files
- Calling external APIs
- Generating PDF reports
- Video transcoding
- Data transformations

The progress tracking mechanism is production-ready - it updates Redis, broadcasts via WebSocket, and updates the dashboard in real-time. Only the simulated work needs to be replaced with your actual use case.

## Real-World Applications

This architecture can be adapted for:

- **Email Campaign Systems**: Queue and send bulk emails with progress tracking
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: ETL jobs with real-time status updates
- **Media Processing**: Video transcoding, image optimization
- **Report Generation**: Async report creation with download notifications
- **Batch Operations**: Any long-running background tasks
- **Webhook Processing**: Handle incoming webhooks asynchronously
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Cron-like task scheduling
- **Integration Tasks**: Third-party API calls with retry logic
